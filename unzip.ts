 * Same as {@link unzip} but accepts an `unzipper` function for each tuple

 * that index returned from `unzipWith`.
 *
 * The `unzipper` takes the current element as its first argument, an
 * accumulator as second argument (initially `undefined`) and its return value
 * is the accumulator passed into the next invocation.
 *
 * @example
 * const [nums, str] = unzipWith(
 *   [ [1,'a'], [2,'b'], [3,'c'] ],
 *   (n, acc: number[] = []) => [...acc, n],
 *   (c, str = '') => str + c
